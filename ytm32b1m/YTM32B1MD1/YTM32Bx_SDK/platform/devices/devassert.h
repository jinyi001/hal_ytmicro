 * @brief Development-time assertion helpers for shared device support code.
 * @details
 * This header provides the `DEV_ASSERT()` contract used throughout the shared
 * device layer to validate input parameters and check static invariants.
 * Because a failed validation usually indicates a software defect in the
 * application or integration code rather than a recoverable runtime error,
 * enabling these checks is recommended during development.
 *
 * The default implementation is controlled by the following compile-time
 * symbols:
 * - `DEV_ERROR_DETECT`
 *   - Defined: validations are enabled. A failed condition triggers
 *     `BKPT_ASM` and then halts execution in an infinite loop so the fault
 *     can be inspected in a debugger.
 *   - Undefined: `DEV_ASSERT()` becomes `((void)0)`, removing the runtime
 *     checking overhead from optimized production builds.
 * - `CUSTOM_DEVASSERT`
 *   - Define this symbol as a quoted header name such as
 *     `"custom_devassert.h"` to provide an application-specific backend.
 *     This allows the project to replace the default breakpoint behavior with
 *     logging, reset, safe-state entry, or another policy.
 * @{

 * implementation is bypassed entirely.
